# üóøüìÑ‚úÇÔ∏è Rock, Paper, Scissors

A classic command-line implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, written in Python. This project allows a user to play a single round against a computer opponent that makes a random choice.

## How to Play

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Download or clone the `RockPaperScizor.py` file.
3.  Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the file's directory.
4.  Run the script with the following command:
    ```sh
    python RockPaperScizor.py
    ```
5.  Enter your choice (`rock`, `paper`, or `scizor`) when prompted and press Enter to see the result.

## Game Logic

The winner is determined based on the classic rules:
* **Rock** crushes **Scizor**
* **Scizor** cuts **Paper**
* **Paper** covers **Rock**

If both the player and the computer choose the same option, the round is a **Draw**.
